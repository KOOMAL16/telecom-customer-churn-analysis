# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

##  Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical business challenge for telecom companies, directly impacting revenue and customer lifetime value.  
This project focuses on analyzing telecom customer data to identify key drivers of churn and to support **data-driven customer retention strategies**.

The objective is not only to predict churn, but also to translate analytical insights into **clear, actionable business recommendations**.

---

##  Business Objective
- Understand customer behavior and factors influencing churn  
- Identify high-risk customers early  
- Support retention teams with actionable insights  
- Reduce avoidable revenue loss through targeted interventions  

---

## Approach & Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer demographics, tenure, contract types, service usage, and billing information  
- Identified key churn indicators such as:
  - Contract type (month-to-month vs long-term)
  - Customer tenure
  - Monthly charges
  - Value-added service subscriptions  

### 2. Feature Engineering & Data Preparation
- Cleaned and prepared data for modeling  
- Handled categorical variables and ensured model-ready features  

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Built and evaluated classification models to predict customer churn  
- Compared model performance using business-relevant metrics  
- Selected models based on interpretability and practical usability

##  Key Insights
- Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show significantly higher churn risk  
- **Short-tenure customers** are more likely to leave early  
- Higher **monthly charges** correlate with increased churn  
- Customers subscribed to **bundled or value-added services** exhibit better retention  

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Target high-risk month-to-month customers with long-term contract incentives  
- Strengthen onboarding and engagement during early customer tenure  
- Promote bundled services to increase perceived value and customer stickiness  
- Use churn predictions to prioritize retention outreach and optimize marketing spend  
- Continuously monitor churn trends and refresh models as customer behavior evolves  

---

##  Business Impact
This analysis enables telecom teams to move from reactive churn handling to **proactive retention planning**.  
By identifying customers at risk early, businesses can improve customer lifetime value, reduce churn-related revenue loss, and enhance overall customer satisfaction.
